        <p class="song-lyrics">One love, one heart<br>
Let's get together and feel all right<br>
Hear the children crying <em><strong>(One love)</strong></em><br>
Hear the children crying <em><strong>(One heart)</strong></em><br>
Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right<br>
Sayin', "Let's get together and feel all right<br>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br></p>

<p class="song-lyrics">Let them all pass all their dirty remarks <em><strong>(one love)</strong></em><br>
There is one question I'd really love to ask <em><strong>(one heart)</strong></em><br>
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner<br>
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?<br>
Believe me</p>

<p class="song-lyrics">One love, one heart<br>
Let's get together and feel all right<br>
As it was in the beginning <em><strong>(one love)</strong></em><br>
So shall it be in the end <em><strong>(one heart)</strong></em><br>
Alright, give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right<br>
Let's get together and feel all right<br>
One more thing</p>

<p class="song-lyrics">Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon <em><strong>(one love)</strong></em><br>
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom <em><strong>(one song)</strong></em><br>
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner<br>
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation</p>
<p class="song-lyrics">Sayin', one love, one heart<br>
Let's get together and feel all right<br>
I'm pleading to mankind <em><strong>(one love)</strong></em><br>
Oh, Lord <em><strong>(one heart)</strong></em> whoa</p>

<p class="song-lyrics">Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right<br>
Let's get together and feel all right</p>

<p class="song-lyrics">Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right<br>
Let's get together and feel all right</p>.
